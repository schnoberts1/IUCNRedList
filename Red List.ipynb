This lead to the loss of natural springs and greatly deteriorated water quality.&#160;The snails on which this species predominately fed were also thought to be particularly sensitive to changes in the water level and quality, so its food base would have rapidly declined (Miller<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;1989).\n",

      "Kihansi Spray Toad The serious decline and extinction of this species appears tp be related to the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project, which involved the construction of a dam upstream on the Kihansi River in 2000. The dam cut off 90% of the original water flow to the gorge, thereby hugely reducing the volume of spray, particularly in the dry season, as well as altering the vegetational composition. <br/><br/>An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system was set up to mimic the natural spray of the Kihansi ecosystem with the remaining water flow. Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006). The impact of predation by safari ants (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dorylus</span> sp.) and crabs (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Potomonautes</span> sp.) is unknown (Channing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2006).\n",

An increased level of desiccation has also been reported from the area once occupied by this species (C. Pedraza-Lara pers. comm. 2010). This seems to have led to the complete desiccation of most, if not all, of the springs which formerly supported populations of this species&#160;(F. Alvarez pers. comm. 2010), while the agricultural industry responsible for this water abstraction has now collapsed in the area owing to a lack of groundwater.\n",
